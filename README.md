## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Doguscan

I'm a game programmer who always strives to write clean, performant code and design robust, modular systems.

I enjoy refactoring the code a lot to make it tidier and robuster.

You can find some of my small scoped projects here that I tried to reflect experience and knowledge at the time I had. I would always very much like to hear your feedback if you visit here and think some things could have been done better. :v:
